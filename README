This is a simple interactive, multi-user, 3D, online application,
based on KataJS and Sirikata.

Easy Deployment
===============
Probably the easiest way to get the application up and running for
testing is to install using the EC2 scripts. Note that these are
really just a scripted version of the full instructions below, so they
will also work on a regular Ubuntu installation and could be easily
adapted to other distributions and platforms. However, many services
run as root (god for monitoring the space server and the web server
for running on port 80), so an isolated environment is encouraged.

(NOTE: The ec2-build.sh script installed default-jre, which currently
 hangs on some micro instances on EC2. If you want to host on a micro
 instance, you might need to run the install portion with an EBS image
 on a larger instance, then move it back to a micro instance.)

To build and deploy, use the ec2 scripts in contrib as follows:
1. Setup a security group that leaves TCP connections for SSH (22),
   Web (80) and Sirikata (7777 by default).
2. Boot up a base image, e.g.
   099720109477/ebs/ubuntu-images/ubuntu-maverick-10.10-i386-server-20101007.1
   using this security group.
3. Copy the ec2 scripts onto the server:
    local> scp -i me.pem contrib/ec2-build.sh contrib/ec2-run.sh ec2-x-y-z-w.compute.amazonaws.com
4. SSH into the server
    local> ssh -i me.pem ubuntu@ec2-x-y-z-w.compute.amazonaws.com
5. Run the build script. This installs system dependencies (will ask
   for sudo password), checkout out both source trees, compile the
   space server and grab some extra dependencies for KataJS/Kataspace.
    remote> ./ec2-build.sh
   Note that unless you update any
   source code, you should only need to perform this step once.
6. Customize your deployment. At a minimum, you need to edit
   scripts/deployment.js to point to your server. For example
    SpaceURL = "loop://localhost";
   would become
    SpaceURL = "sirikata://ec2-x-y-z-w.compute.amazonaws.com:7777";
   Currently you need to do this manually to make sure you get the
   hostname correct.  Also feel free to modify other setings in this
   file, for example to add your own avatars.
6. Run the servers.
    remote> ./ec2-run.sh
   This starts the God, which in turn starts the Sirikata space
   server. It also starts lighttpd on port 80, serving files directly
   from the Kataspace directory.
7. Connect to the server. Visit
   http://ec2-x-y-z-w.compute.amazonaws.com/ to start using the
   space.

Full Instructions
=================
The following gives the full instructions for compiling the space
server, running it, and running the application, based on KataJS, from
on a web server.

Server
------
To interact with other users we connect to a Sirikata space server.
See http://sirikata.com for details.  If you want to set up a server
to connect to, download the code for Sirikata and build the space
server. Using the minimal set of dependencies is sufficient because
only the server component is used -- KataJS provides the client-side
code for connecting to a Sirikata space.

Once you have the code, simply run the space server
(sirikata/build/cmake/space, append _d for the debug version). The
appropriate ports are hard-coded into the application to work with the
defaults.  If you need to use different ports, or want to point to a
server other than localhost, make the appropriate changes in index.html.

To "protect" against crashes, you can use monitoring software to
ensure the server is restored in case of a crash. The EC2 scripts use
God (http://god.rubyforge.org/), and the Sirikata code has a sample
God script (under tools/space/space.god.rb).

Client
------
The code in this repository, along with KataJS, included as an
submodule, is a full client for Sirikata-based worlds. Because we rely
on KataJS, which in turn relies on other libraries, there's quite a
bit of initialization.  This should all be wrapped up nicely in the
Makefile, so simply typing

make

in this directory should make sure all the libraries are up to date
and built. This application must then be served by a web server.  A
convenient way to do that is to run

./externals/katajs/contrib/lighttpd.py

from this directory, which uses lighttp to serve this directory from
localhost:8888.  To view the application, enter

http://localhost:8888/

into your browser.
